New to me:<br/>
 + There are three main VCS (Version Control System).<br/>
 + Git, Subversion, Mercurial.<br/>
	
Surprise me:<br/>
 + Two categories of VCS: Centralized and Distributed.<br/>
 + Status of the document in Google Documents is a link with<br/>
different versions of document.<br/>

I intend to use in the future:<br/>
 - EVERYTHING

1.Linux CLI, HTTP<br/>
=================
New to me:<br/>
GET: fetch an existing resource. The URL contains all the necessary information the server needs to locate<br/> 
and return the resource.<br/>

POST: create a new resource. POST requests usually carry a payload that specifies the data for the new resource.<br/>

PUT: update an existing resource. The payload may contain the updated data for the resource.<br/>
DELETE: delete an existing resource.<br/>

Post = Put + Delete (sometimes)<br/>

HEAD: this is similar to GET, but without the message body. It's used to retrieve the server headers <br/>
for a particular resource, generally to check if the resource has changed, via timestamps.<br/>

TRACE: used to retrieve the hops that a request takes to round trip from the server. Each intermediate <br/>
proxy or gateway would inject its IP or DNS name into the Via header field. This can be used for diagnostic <br/>
purposes.<br/>

OPTIONS: used to retrieve the server capabilities. On the client-side, it can be used to modify the request <br/>
based on what the server can support.<br/>

In HTTP/1.0, all connections were closed after a single transaction. So, if a client wanted to request <br/>
three separate images from the same server, it made three separate connections to the remote host.<br/>

To reduce connection-establishment delays, HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections, long-lived connections<br/> 
that stay open until the client closes them.<br/>
